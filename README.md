 Videos of radial wicking of oil and milk

This dataset contains videos of wicking of oil and milk samples on a filter paper. Each of the oil and milk folders contains pure and adulterated videos. The adulteration level is denoted by the number before 'p' in the folder name. The milk samples are created by mixing raw milk with water. The oil samples are created by mixing cold-pressed mustard oil with palmolein oil.

The videos are minimally processed. The videos are of the original length. The frame is cropped and scaled to 256x256 which is close to the original resolution.

The videos can be used to train convolutional networks to identify pure samples from adulterated samples.
